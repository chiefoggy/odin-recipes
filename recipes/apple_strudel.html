    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This apple strudel is very easy to make with apples, raisins, and frozen puff pastry, yet it looks impressive and tastes amazing! A truly delicious fall dessert.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apples: </strong>The tartness from Granny Smith apples perfectly balances the sweet brown sugar. </li>
        <li><strong>Brown sugar: </strong>Opt for light brown sugar for the perfect sweet, cozy flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Golden raisins: </strong>Golden raisins take the flavor and texture up a few notches. </li>
        <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour thickens the apple strudel filling.  </li>
        <li><strong>Puff Pastry: </strong>Two thawed puff pastry sheets are key to making this easy apple strudel.  </li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it wonâ€™t make the strudel taste salty.   </li>
        <li><strong>Puff Pastry: </strong>Two thawed puff pastry sheets are key to making this easy apple strudel.  </li>
        <li><strong>Egg and milk: </strong>Brushing an egg wash (made with one egg and a tablespoon of whole milk) over the puff pastry before baking ensures a gorgeous golden brown finish.   </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Place shredded and chopped apples in a large bowl. Stir in brown sugar, golden raisins, flour, and salt; set aside. </li>
        <li>Working with one sheet at a time, place puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Roll lightly with a rolling pin into an approximately 10- x 12-inch rectangle. Arrange 1/2 of the apple filling (about 3 cups) down one side of pastry lengthwise. </li>
        <li>Fold pastry lengthwise over apple mixture; dampen edges of pastry with water, then press or crimp edges to seal. Repeat process with 2nd pastry sheet and remaining apple mixture. </li>
        <li>Transfer to prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 2-inches between each pastry. Whisk egg and milk together in a small bowl; brush on top of each pastry. Cut 3 or 4 slits on top of each pastry to allow steam to escape. </li> 
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
